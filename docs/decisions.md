# Protocol Decisions (through Step 3)

This is a running log of decisions made while implementing
[../../ml-dsa-auth-protocol-spec.md](../../ml-dsa-auth-protocol-spec.md), for
anything the spec left underspecified or that required resolving an
ambiguity. The spec itself (Section 6.3 onward) is the normative source for
wire format and protocol behavior; this file explains *why* those choices
were made and points at where each was decided.

## Key exchange: X25519 only in v1

Section 10's `[DECISION NEEDED]` is resolved: v1 uses classical X25519 for
key exchange. Hybrid X25519 + ML-KEM-768 is deferred to a v2 milestone.
Rationale: ML-DSA-65 already resolves the more time-critical threat
(active identity/downgrade attacks); the "harvest now, decrypt later"
threat hybrid KEX defends against targets long-lived confidentiality, not
per-session ephemeral secrets, and is less urgent than shipping a smaller,
fully-hardened v1 first. See Section 10 and this session's Step 1 planning
notes for the full tradeoff writeup (complexity/performance/dependency
surface).

## liboqs: ML-DSA-65 only

`liboqs` is built with `-DOQS_MINIMAL_BUILD=SIG_ml_dsa_65` — no other
signature algorithm and no KEM algorithm is compiled in, keeping the
built library's algorithm surface (and thus attack surface) to exactly
what v1 uses. Confirmed via symbol inspection of the built static library
(only `OQS_SIG_ml_dsa_65_*` symbols present). This will need revisiting
when/if v2 adds ML-KEM-768.

## Dependencies are pinned, not floated

Per spec Section 3. `liboqs` is fetched via CMake `FetchContent` at
`GIT_TAG 0.16.0`; `libsodium` is fetched as a release *distribution
tarball* (not a raw git checkout) at version `1.0.22`, pinned by
`URL_HASH` (SHA-256 of the tarball itself — stronger than a commit pin
alone, since it's byte-exact). See
[../cmake/Dependencies.cmake](../cmake/Dependencies.cmake) for the exact
resolved commit SHAs recorded for both, for audit purposes.

## `handshake_id`: a 16-byte truncated SHA-256 transcript identifier

`ClientAuth` carries `handshake_id`, the first 16 bytes of
`SHA-256("mldsa-auth/v1/handshake-id" || 0x00 || encode(ClientHello) ||
encode(ServerHello))` — a deterministic value derived from the full
pre-`ClientAuth` transcript, used by the responder to look up which
pending handshake a given `ClientAuth` belongs to. It is **not** an
authentication mechanism: it's a lookup hint only. The responder always
recomputes it from its own stored transcript and still verifies `sig_A`
against that transcript before accepting anything — a forged or
mismatched `handshake_id` can only cause a lookup miss, never a forged
acceptance. An earlier draft used a raw, caller-supplied
`ClientAuth.session_id` field instead; that was rejected specifically
because it would have been an unauthenticated routing value with no
cryptographic relationship to the handshake it claimed to identify. See
[../../ml-dsa-auth-protocol-spec.md](../../ml-dsa-auth-protocol-spec.md)
Section 6.3.3 for the normative definition.

## Network framing and cross-message acceptance: deferred to Step 4

Step 3 (wire format) implements structural serialization only:
deterministic encode/decode for `ClientHello`/`ServerHello`/`ClientAuth`,
with strict per-field bounds checking and full-buffer consumption. It
does **not** implement: actual socket/transport framing, comparing
`ServerHello.session_id_echo` or `ClientAuth.handshake_id` against
anything, reconstructing transcripts from stored state, verifying
signatures against a live peer identity, or any session lifecycle
(pending-handshake expiry, single-use/replay enforcement). All of that is
Step 4 (`handshake_ctx`, Section 8) and later steps' responsibility — a
structurally well-formed message can still be semantically wrong, and
Step 3's decoders have no way to know that. See spec Section 6.3.5 for
the explicit division of responsibility.
